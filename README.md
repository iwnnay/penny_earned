<h1>Penny Earned</h1>
<p>Penny Earned is a banking application that I started to develop in December 2014 because I was having a hard time finding
financial planning software that met all of my needs. My goal is to make something that is truly flexible and works with the
way that people spend their money: on a monthly basis.</p>

<h3>Current Version: 1.0.0</h3>
<p>This is a work in progress. The application is to the point where a user can sign in and manage their monthly expenses</p>

<h3>Release Notes</h3>
<ul><b>Version 1.0.0</b>
<li><b>Users:</b> Utilizes devise to keep track of users</li>
<li><b>Monthly Accounting:</b> Think of it as balancing your checkbook. Once an account is created you'll be able to plan over the next couple years.</li>
<li><b>Single Transactions:</b> The foundation of banking, you're able to create a transaction that is either a debit or credit to the account. Comes with date, description and amount</li>
<li><b>State of Transaction:</b> Track whether a transaction is a placeholer, a sent payment, or paid</li>
<li><b>Categorization:</b> Categorizing the transaction will help with budgeting and searching when it's added. For now it's just good for the user to be able to track.</li>
<li><b>Recurring:</b> Avoid re-entering transactions every month</li>
<li><b>Current Status:</b> See quickly what your current and estimated account amount is in the upper right hand corner</li>
<li><b>High and Low:</b> See which future month has the highest and lowest projection</li>
</ul>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Beautification:</b> I know the app looks like ass. I'm working on that.</li>
<li><b>Budgets:</b> I see these being goals, or limitations within an account. These should help one stay on track (eg. Food Budget, Entertainments Budget). Relies on the categories to check amounts</li>
<li><b>Profile Pages:</b> It's one thing to be able to log in and out, but one should be able to manage how they're seen by the app.</li>
<li><b>Credit Cards:</b> Like that Uncle that won't forgive you for that time you did something stupid to his property or children, we all have them. It'd be nice to manage those Uncles with the app, but I'll settle for credit cards.</li>
<li><b>Loans:</b> If you've been to school or bought a house in your life time you probably have these. Soon you could track them.</li>
<li><b>libofx:</b> Automatic tracking of transaction from a bank account. This would be really nice to have. I see myself adding this sooner rather than later.</li>
<li><b>QA:</b> No project would be complete without it. I see bugs everyonce in a while while I'm using it. I plan on creating tickets for myself. If you find yourself using the app don't hesitate to create an issue</li>
<li><b>JavaScript Test Coverage:</b> This will be sooner than later. I don't like letting code hang out untested, but here I am doing it.</li>
